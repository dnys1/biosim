To begin, BioSim requires a few initial parameters. These parameters determine the required area for crop growth, water treatment, and living space. They also set parameters about the environment which will change how energy, water and air move throughout the system. 

After clicking "Start", buttons will activate in the remaining tabs which allow you to step the simulation for various time steps. A timer will also start in the upper left-hand corner which shows the current date and time.
