    abstract = {Soil water retention parameters are critical to quantify flow and solute transport in vadose zone, while the presence of rock fragments remarkably increases their variability. Therefore a novel method for determining water retention parameters of soil-gravel mixtures is required. The procedure to generate such a model is based firstly on the determination of the quantitative relationship between the content of rock fragments and the effective saturation of soil-gravel mixtures, and then on the integration of this relationship with former analytical equations of water retention curves (WRCs). In order to find such relationships, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine WRCs of soil-gravel mixtures obtained with a clay loam soil mixed with shale clasts or pebbles in three size groups with various gravel contents. Data showed that the effective saturation of the soil-gravel mixtures with the same kind of gravels within one size group had a linear relation with gravel contents, and had a power relation with the bulk density of samples at any pressure head. Revised formulas for water retention properties of the soil-gravel mixtures are proposed to establish the water retention curved surface models of the power-linear functions and power functions. The analysis of the parameters obtained by regression and validation of the empirical models showed that they were acceptable by using either the measured data of separate gravel size group or those of all the three gravel size groups having a large size range. Furthermore, the regression parameters of the curved surfaces for the soil-gravel mixtures with a large range of gravel content could be determined from the water retention data of the soil-gravel mixtures with two representative gravel contents or bulk densities. Such revised water retention models are potentially applicable in regional or large scale field investigations of significantly heterogeneous media, where various gravel sizes and different gravel contents are present.},

    abstract="In order to assess and accurately predict the self-purification capabilities of rivers with respect to enteric pollution, a thorough understanding of mechanisms such as dispersion, particle association, and inactivation in the water column is crucial. In this study, we firstly performed particle size distribution analyses of wastewater and investigated the Escherichia coli and enterococci loadings of each size fraction. It was seen that 91 {\%} of E. coli and 83 {\%} of enterococci were associated with particle sizes less than or equal to 12 $\mu$m. Particles larger than 63 $\mu$m contributed less than 1 {\%} to overall E. coli and enterococci loadings. Based on these results, batch experiments were performed to investigate the effect of particle size and total suspended solids (TSS) concentration on UV inactivation of the two fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). A direct relationship between the particle size to which FIB were associated and their UV inactivation rate was noted. E. coli and enterococci associated with particles smaller than or equal to 12 $\mu$m were inactivated on average 2{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}and 1.7{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}faster than those associated with the larger particle fraction of 12 to 63 $\mu$m. It was additionally seen that as the TSS concentrations increased, the UV inactivation rates decreased. A tailing effect of UV inactivation was however noted at TSS concentrations above approximately 100 mg L−1.",
