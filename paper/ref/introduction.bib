Our goal is’ to define the minimum biological processing necessary to make waste streams compatible with plant growth in hydroponic systems, thereby recycling nutrients into plant biomass and recovering water via atmospheric condensate. Initial small ‘and intermediate-scale studies focused on the recycling of nutrients contained in inedible pl,ant biomass. Studies conducted between 1989- 1992 indicated that the majority of nutrients could be rapidly solubilized in ,water, but the direct use of this crop “leachate” was deleterious to plant growth due to die presence of soluble organic compounds. Subsequent studies at both the intermediate scale and in the large-scale Biomass Production Chamber (BPC) have indicated that aerobic microbiological processing of crop residue prior to incorporation into recirculating hydroponic solutions eliminated any phytotoxic effect, even when the majority of the plant nutrient demand was provided from recycled biomass during long term studies (i.e. up to 418 days) Current and future studies are focused on optimizing biological processing of both plant and human waste streams.}, number={10}, journal={Advances in Space Research}, author={Garland, J.L. and Mackowiak, C.L. and Strayer, R.F. and Finger, B.W.}, year={1997}, month={1}, pages={1821–1826} }

The focus of this project over the past two years has been the development of the plant growth facility, the first module of the CELSS. The other major modules, food preparation, biomass processing, and resource recovery, have been researched at the laboratory scale during the past two years and facilities are currently under construction to scale—up these modules to an operational state. This paper will outline the design requirements for the Biomass Production Chamber (BPC), the plant growth facility for the project, and the control and monitoring subsystems which operate the chamber and will present results from both engineering and biological tests of the facility. Three production evaluations of wheat, conducted in the BPC during the past year, will be described and the data generated from these tests discussed. Future plans for the BPC will be presented along with future goals for the project as the other modules become active.}, number={5}, journal={Advances in Space Research}, author={Knott, W.

These research and development needs have prompted NASA to seek and coordinate assessment from both national and international space medicine practice as well as biomedical research communities.  Review of NASA's Human Research Program Evidence Books: A Letter Report examines NASA's plans to assemble the available evidence on human health risks of spaceflight and moves forward in identifying and addressing gaps in research. Recommendations to strengthen the content, composition, and dissemination of the evidence books are intended to improve future versions of these critical documents. These evidence books should be the continuously updated knowledge base of best evidence regarding risks to human health associated with spaceflight, particularly spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit and of long duration. Such a knowledge base will serve the interests of mission planners, researchers, and ultimately the individuals who accept those risks in their role as space travelers.",

In an earth-based CELSS, both negative and positive differential pressures of atmosphere are created as the resultant of three influences: thermal expansion/contraction, transition of water between liquid and vapor phases, and external barometric pressure variations. The resultant may typically be on the order of 5000 pascals. By providing a flexible expansion chamber, the differential pressure range can be reduced two, or even three, orders of magnitude, which correspondingly reduces the leakage. The expansion chamber itself can also be used to measure the leak rate. Independent confirmation is possible by measurement of the progressive dilution of a trace gas. These methods as employed at the Biosphere 2 facility have resulted in an estimated atmospheric leak rate of less than I0 percent per year.}, number={11}, journal={Advances in Space Research}, author={Dempster, William F.}, year={1994}, month={11}, pages={331–335} }
